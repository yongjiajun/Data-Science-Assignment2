The “[1994 United States Census Income](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult)” dataset, also known as the “Adult” dataset contains 14 attributes including one class attribute and 32561 instances. Thanks to its donors, Ronny and Barry who both graciously donated the dataset in 1996, it has been one of the most popular datasets that is used for predicting whether a person’s income exceeds US$50k per year based on the census data collected in 1994 in the United States of America. It has been chosen due to its high success rate to perform data modelling with classification methods as recommended by the [UCI Machine learning Repository website](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult). 

**The aim of the report is to explore the dataset using visualisations, model the given data using classification methods with K-nearest Neighbour Classifier and Decision Tree Classifier, analyse the performance of each classifier and provide recommendation for which classifier should be used.**
